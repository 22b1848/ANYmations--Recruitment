# ANYmations--Recruitment
Astrophysics Subsystem Recruitment
- The uploaded Files were my submissions for the recruitment assignment of Astrophysics subsystem of ANYmations team, IIT Bombay.
- I completed these in my freshman year of Undergraduation.
- These are the first set of codes I wrote myself and learnt coding from scratch for this.
- Yeah, it is true that I didn't know any coding in any language before this.
- Also, I hated coding like hell before doing this assignment, not that I like it a lot even today.
